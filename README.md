# Lab_4

The Task 5 folder has game.py written with the necessary classes. I didn't know what to put in the Friend class, so it doesn't do anything.

Task 6 is a game that builds on game.py from Task 6, but makes important changes and implements its own main.py.

Most importantly, the main goal to to get your friend from shotitam and get back to ucu. There's also rule changes:

you can lose to enemies if you still have health left
you cannot advance if you haven't killed the enemy
you can recruit friends (with the gift command) to gain either weapons or more health points
